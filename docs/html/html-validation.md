## Why Validate Your HTML Code

As a beginner it is very common that you will make mistake in writing your HTML code. Incorrect or non-standard code may cause unexpected results in how your page displayed or function in browsers.

To prevent this you can test or validate your HTML code against the formal guidelines and standards set by the Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for HTML/XHTML web pages.

The World Wide Web Consortium provide a simple online tool ([https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)) that automatically check your HTML code and point out any problems/errors your code might have, such as missing closing tags or missing quotes around attributes.

## Validating a Web Page

Validating a web page is a process of ensuring that it conforms to the norms or standards defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which is the authority to maintain HTML standards.

There are several specific reasons for validating a web page, some of them are:

-   It helps to create web pages that are cross-browser, cross-platform compatible. It also likely to be compatible with the future version of web browsers and web standards.
-   Standards compliant web pages increase the search engine spiders and crawlers visibility, as a result your web pages will more likely be appear in search results.
-   It will reduce unexpected errors and make your web pages more accessible to the visitor.
